# MIT 6.004 CPU Project

## Overview

This repository contains the design for the CPU project completed as part of MIT 6.004 coursework. The project involved the design and implementation of a processor, encompassing 
key components such as the program counter, control logic, ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), and a register file. Additionally, a small operating system was developed to efficiently manage 
various processes on the CPU.

## Project Highlights

- **Processor Design:**
  - Engineered vital components of the processor, ensuring optimal performance.
  - Designed the program counter to facilitate program execution and control flow.
  - Implemented control logic for managing instruction execution and coordinating different CPU components.
  - Developed an ALU for performing arithmetic and logical operations within the CPU.
  - Designed and implemented a register file for efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **Integration:**
  - Integrated the individual components into a cohesive unit, transforming abstract concepts into a fully functional CPU.
  - Ensured seamless communication and interaction between different modules.

- **Operating System Development:**
  - Extended the project scope by creating a small operating system.
  - Implemented process management functionalities to efficiently handle various processes running on the CPU.
  - Enhanced system functionality through effective process coordination.
